# Arcade-Game
A two player PC game known as Arcade Game.
I completed this game using Turtle library of Python. 
I created 3 objects two of them are for left and right paddle while the one is the for ball. 
Left paddle moves with w,a,s,d while right paddle moves with arrow keys.
Left and Right paddle are extended 10 pixels up and down from their centers. 
Game starts with the ball in center while paddles on their positions.
The ball moves in random position if it hits top or bottom, it is reflected.
The player must has to hit with the paddle if this collision doesn't occurs and the ball goes out from the left or right side of the width of the screen a message will be displayed on the screen "Game Over".
